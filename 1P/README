6

What challenges did you encounter? And how did you address them?
First, I had issues correctly implementing values into the vector from a stringstream.
Then i found another way to implement the values into the vector by going directly
into the vector from the ifstream using stod().
Second, I had issues getting the right minutes passed but then I got it to work after
many trials and errors.
Third, I had major issues trying to figure out how to get the code to know if
there were invalid characters. I solved the issue by using the isdigit() function
from C. Then I changed the value of the bad characters to -1 so I could find it
later and call an error.
