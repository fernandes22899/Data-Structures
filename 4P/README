What challenges did you encounter? And how did you address them?
Stack was an easy implementation since it was very similar to the lab.
Queue on the other hand was not as easy to implement and I got issues
where it would abort and dump all values but I didn't know where it happened.
I realized I had a couple of sizing issues in the dump and dequeue methods.
